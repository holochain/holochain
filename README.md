# Holochain

Holochain is an open-source framework to develop peer-to-peer applications with high levels of security, reliability, and performance.

### Code Status

This code is in initial Beta release. It's ready for limited production use. It is still undergoing security reviews and hardening of network protocols. 

## Running Holochain Applications (hApps)

This repository contains the Holochain core libraries, not the runtime intended for end-users of Holochain applications.

If you just want to install and run Holochain and apps from its AppStore, download the latest release of [Holochain Launcher](https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases) appropriate for Linux, Mac, or Windows. 

## Installing Holochain for App Development
