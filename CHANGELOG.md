## Unreleased:

### Added
- `InstallAppBundle` command added to admin conductor API. [#665](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665)
- `DnaSource` in conductor_api `RegisterDna` call now can take a `DnaBundle` [#665](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665)
### Removed
- BREAKING:  `InstallAppDnaPayload` in admin conductor API `InstallApp` command now only accepts a hash.  Both properties and path have been removed as per deprecation warning.  Use either `RegisterDna` or `InstallAppBundle` instead. [#665](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665)
- temporarily removed `install_app` from `hc`: its not clear if we should restore yet as mostly should be using `install_app_bundle` [#665](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665)
### Changed
- BREAKING: `DnaSource(Path)` in conductor_api `RegisterDna` call now must point to `DnaBundle` as created by `hc dna pack` not a `DnaFile` created by `dna_util` [#665](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665)

## 20210304.120604
This will include the hdk-0.0.100 release.

### Changed
- hdk: fixup the autogenerated hdk documentation.

## 20210226.155101

This release was initiated for publishing the HDK at version _0.0.100-alpha.1_.
We are in the process of redefining the release process around this repository so rough edges are still expected at this point.

### Added
- Added App Validation workflow that runs app validation as authority [#330](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/330)
- Added validation package to entry defs see for usage [#344](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/344)
- Implemented the `emit_signals` host function [#371](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/371), which broadcasts a signal across all app interfaces (fine-grained pub/sub to be done in future work)
- get_details on a HeaderHash now returns the updates if it's an entry header
- call host fn (This is an actual function not a macro). Allows you to call a zome that is installed on the same conductor. [#453](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/453)
- Added create link HeaderHash to the Link type
- `remote_signal` host function to send a signal to a list of agents without blocking on the responses.
See [#546](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/546) or the docs for the hdk.
- `hc` utility. Work with DNA and hApp bundle files, set up sandbox environments for testing and development purposes, make direct admin calls to running conductors, and more.

### Changed

- BREAKING: get_details and get_links_details return SignedHeaderHashed instead of the header types [#390](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/390)
- BREAKING: ZomeInfo now returns the ZomeId [#390](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/390)
- BREAKING: HoloHash now serializes as a plain 39-byte sequence, instead of a `{hash, hash_type}` structure [#459](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/459)
- BREAKING: (Almost) all HDK functions have been converted from macros to functions [#478](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/478)
- Admin interface method `install_app` has its `app_id` field renamed to `installed_app_id` so as not to conflict with the future concept of an "app id"
- Admin interface method `list_active_app_ids` renamed to `list_active_apps`
- BREAKING: JSON replaced with YAML for DNA Properties as well as the DNA manifest (dna.yaml instead of dna.json) [#592](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/592)
- BREAKING: format of AppInfo changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

- The `dna_util` has absorbed by the new `hc` utility.

### Fixed

- If installing the same app_id twice, previously the second installation would overwrite the first. Now it is an error to do so.

### Security
