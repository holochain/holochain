# Changelog

This file conveniently consolidates all of the crates individual CHANGELOG.md files and groups them by timestamps at which crates were released. The file is updated every time one or more crates are released.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [fixt](crates/fixt/CHANGELOG.md#unreleased)

### Changed

- Named bytes fixturators like `SixtyFourBytes` are now fixed length arrays

### Added

- Added `SixtyFourBytesVec` to work like the old `Vec<u8>` implementation

## [holochain\_zome\_types](crates/holochain_zome_types/CHANGELOG.md#unreleased)

### Changed

- `Signature` is a 64 byte ‘secure primitive’

## [hdk](crates/hdk/CHANGELOG.md#unreleased)

### Changed

- Added `HdkT` trait to support mocking the host and native rust unit tests

### Added

- Added `sign_ephemeral` and `sign_ephemeral_raw`

## [holochain\_types](crates/holochain_types/CHANGELOG.md#unreleased)

### Changed

- BREAKING: All references to `"uuid"` in the context of DNA has been renamed to `"uid"` to reflect that these IDs are not universally unique, but merely unique with regards to the zome code (the genotype) [\#727](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/727)

## [holochain\_cli](crates/holochain_cli/CHANGELOG.md#unreleased)

### Removed

- temporarily removed `install_app` from `hc`: its not clear if we should restore yet as mostly should be using `install_app_bundle` [\#665](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665)

## [holochain](crates/holochain/CHANGELOG.md#unreleased)

This version contains breaking changes to the conductor API as well as a major upgrade to the underlying Wasm runtime.

***:exclamation: Performance impact***

The version of wasmer that is used in this holochain release contains bugs in the scoping of wasmer modules vs. instances, such that it blocks the proper release of memory and slows down execution of concurrent Wasm instances. This has negative a impact on performance and memory usage. We were able to mitigate at least the memory impact to a certain extent and are coordinating with wasmer to create a proper solution as soon as possible.

The severity of these issues increases with cell concurrency, i.e. using multiple cells with the same DNA. Application development with a single conductor and a few cells are expected to work well unless your machine has serious resource restrictions.

### Added

- `InstallAppBundle` command added to admin conductor API. [\#665](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665)
- `DnaSource` in conductor\_api `RegisterDna` call now can take a `DnaBundle` [\#665](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665)

### Removed

- BREAKING:  `InstallAppDnaPayload` in admin conductor API `InstallApp` command now only accepts a hash.  Both properties and path have been removed as per deprecation warning.  Use either `RegisterDna` or `InstallAppBundle` instead. [\#665](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665)
- BREAKING: `DnaSource(Path)` in conductor\_api `RegisterDna` call now must point to `DnaBundle` as created by `hc dna pack` not a `DnaFile` created by `dna_util` [\#665](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665)

### CHANGED

- Updated to a version of `holochain_wasmer` that includes a migration to wasmer v2+. [\#773](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/773/files), [\#801](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/80), [\#836](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/836)

# \[20210304.120604\]

This will include the hdk-0.0.100 release.

## [hdk-0.0.100](crates/hdk/CHANGELOG.md#0.0.100)

### Changed

- hdk: fixup the autogenerated hdk documentation.

# 20210226.155101

## Global

This release was initiated for publishing the HDK at version *0.0.100-alpha.1*. We are in the process of redefining the release process around this repository so rough edges are still expected at this point.

### Added

- Added App Validation workflow that runs app validation as authority [\#330](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/330)
- Added validation package to entry defs see for usage [\#344](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/344)
- Implemented the `emit_signals` host function [\#371](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/371), which broadcasts a signal across all app interfaces (fine-grained pub/sub to be done in future work)
- get\_details on a HeaderHash now returns the updates if it’s an entry header
- call host fn (This is an actual function not a macro). Allows you to call a zome that is installed on the same conductor. [\#453](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/453)
- Added create link HeaderHash to the Link type
- `remote_signal` host function to send a signal to a list of agents without blocking on the responses. See [\#546](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/546) or the docs for the hdk.
- `hc` utility. Work with DNA and hApp bundle files, set up sandbox environments for testing and development purposes, make direct admin calls to running conductors, and more.

### Changed

- BREAKING: get\_details and get\_links\_details return SignedHeaderHashed instead of the header types [\#390](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/390)
- BREAKING: ZomeInfo now returns the ZomeId [\#390](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/390)
- BREAKING: HoloHash now serializes as a plain 39-byte sequence, instead of a `{hash, hash_type}` structure [\#459](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/459)
- BREAKING: (Almost) all HDK functions have been converted from macros to functions [\#478](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/478)
- Admin interface method `install_app` has its `app_id` field renamed to `installed_app_id` so as not to conflict with the future concept of an “app id”
- Admin interface method `list_active_app_ids` renamed to `list_active_apps`
- BREAKING: JSON replaced with YAML for DNA Properties as well as the DNA manifest (dna.yaml instead of dna.json) [\#592](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/592)
- BREAKING: format of AppInfo changed

### Removed

- The `dna_util` has absorbed by the new `hc` utility.

### Fixed

- If installing the same app\_id twice, previously the second installation would overwrite the first. Now it is an error to do so.
