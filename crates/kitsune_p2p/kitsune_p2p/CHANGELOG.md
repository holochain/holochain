## \[Unreleased\]

## 0.3.0-beta-dev.0

- Bump tx5 to include https://github.com/holochain/tx5/pull/31 which should fix the network loop halting on certain error types, like Ban on data send. [\#2315](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2315)
- Removes the experimental `gossip_single_storage_arc_per_space` tuning param
- Fixes sharded gossip issue where storage arcs are not properly quantized in multi-agent-per-node sharded scenarios. [\#2332](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2332)
- Add `gossip_arc_clamping` Kitsune tuning param, allowing initial options to set all storage arcs to empty or full. [\#2352](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2352)
- Changes to arc resizing algorithm to ensure that nodes pick up the slack for freeloading nodes with zero storage arcs. [\#2352](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2352)
- Disables gossip when using `gossip_arc_clamping = "empty"`: when the arc is clamped to empty, the gossip module doesn’t even activate. [\#2380](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2380)

- Adds feature flipper `tx5` which enables experimental integration with holochains WebRTC networking backend. This is not enabled by default. [\#1741](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1741)

## 0.1.0

## 0.1.0-beta-rc.2

## 0.1.0-beta-rc.1

- Fixes some bad logic around leaving spaces, which can cause problems upon rejoining [\#1744](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1744)
  - When an agent leaves a space, an `AgentInfoSigned` with an empty arc is published before leaving. Previously, this empty-arc agent info was also persisted to the database, but this is inappropriate because upon rejoining, they will start with an empty arc. Now, the agent info is removed from the database altogether upon leaving.

## 0.1.0-beta-rc.0

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** The gossip and publishing algorithms have undergone a significant rework, making this version incompatible with previous versions. Rather than gossiping and publishing entire Ops, only hashes are sent, which the recipient uses to maintain a queue of items which need to be fetched from various other sources on the DHT. This allows for finer-grained control over receiving Ops from multiple sources, and allows each node to manage their own incoming data flow. [\#1662](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1662)
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** `AppRequest::GossipInfo` is renamed to `AppRequest::NetworkInfo`, and the fields have changed. Since ops are no longer sent during gossip, there is no way to track overall gossip progress over a discrete time interval. There is now only a description of the total number of ops and total number of bytes waiting to be received. As ops are received, these numbers decrement.

## 0.0.52

- The soft maximum gossip batch size has been lowered to 1MB (entries larger than this will just be in a batch alone), and the default timeouts have been increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds. This is NOT a breaking change, though the usefulness is negated unless the majority of peers are running with the same settings.  [\#1659](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1659)

## 0.0.51

- `rpc_multi` now only actually makes a single request. This greatly simplifies the code path and eliminates a source of network bandwidth congestion, but removes the redundancy of aggregating the results of multiple peers. [\#1651](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1651)

## 0.0.49

## 0.0.48

## 0.0.47

## 0.0.46

## 0.0.45

## 0.0.44

- Fixes a regression where a node can prematurely end a gossip round if their partner signals that they are done sending data, even if the node itself still has more data to send, which can lead to persistent timeouts between the two nodes. [\#1553](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1553)

## 0.0.43

- Increases all gossip bandwidth rate limits to 10mbps, up from 0.1mbps, allowing for gossip of larger entries
- Adds `gossip_burst_ratio` to `KitsuneTuningParams`, allowing tuning of bandwidth bursts
- Fixes a bug where a too-large gossip payload could put the rate limiter into an infinite loop

## 0.0.25

- BREAKING: Gossip messages no longer contain the hash of the ops being gossiped. This is a breaking protocol change.
- Removed the unmaintained “simple-bloom” gossip module in favor of “sharded-gossip”

## 0.0.24

- Agent info is now published as well as gossiped. [\#1115](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1115)
- BREAKING: Network wire message has changed format so will not be compatible with older versions. [1143](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1143).

## 0.0.12

- BREAKING: Return `ShardedGossipWire::Busy` if we are overloaded with incoming gossip. [\#1076](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1076)
  - This breaks the current network protocol and will not be compatible with other older versions of holochain (no manual action required).

## 0.0.11

## 0.0.10

- Check local agents for basis when doing a RPCMulti call. [\#1009](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1009).

## 0.0.9

- Fix rpc\_multi bug that caused all request to wait 3 seconds. [\#1009](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1009/)
- Fix to gossip’s round initiate. We were not timing out a round if there was no response to an initiate message. [\#1014](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1014).
- Make gossip only initiate with agents that have info that is not expired. [\#1014](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1014).

## 0.0.8

### Changed

- `query_gossip_agents`, `query_agent_info_signed`, and `query_agent_info_signed_near_basis` are now unified into a single `query_agents` call in `KitsuneP2pEvent`
