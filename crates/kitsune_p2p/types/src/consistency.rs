//! Types used for consistency checking during tests or dht health checks.
//! These types describe a protocol that can be implemented to gather statistics
//! on data consistency.
//! This is a first prototype so expect this to change.
//!
//! The idea is that a central node can request all the published hashes from a set
//! of nodes on the DHT and then create a consistency session for each node.
//! The sessions can then be sent to each node so they can self-check what they
//! should be holding and then send back small session reports at a set frequency.
//!
//! This allows consistency and health checks to be run at scale with minimal network traffic.
//! It does require honest network nodes. (Although this could be strengthened).
