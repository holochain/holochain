//! Holochain conductor usage documentation.

/// How holochain conductor makes use of rust tracing/logging.
///
/// ### `RUST_LOG` Environment Variable
///
/// See the [tracing-subscriber](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-subscriber)
/// crate's documentation for usage of the EnvFilter. Essentially you can
/// specify tracing/logging levels via the environment variable RUST_LOG.
///
/// Examples:
/// - `RUST_LOG=warn` - only print warn and error levels
/// - `RUST_LOG=trace` - print ALL very verbose tracing logs
/// - `RUST_LOG=off,NETAUDIT=trace` - print ONLY the "NETAUDIT" target tracing
///
/// ### Conductor Config `tracing_override` Field
///
/// If, for some reason you cannot specify an environment variable, you
/// can also set the tracing level via the conductor config
/// `tracing_override` field.
///
/// ### `NETAUDIT` Target
///
/// The special `NETAUDIT` target is a cross-crate tracing target for
/// getting a handle on what conductor is doing with remote communications
/// under the hood. Specific traces are output in:
/// - sbd-client
/// - tx5-connection
/// - tx5
/// - kitsune_p2p
/// - and holochain itself
///
/// Where appropriate, try to set some standardized properties on the trace:
///
/// - `m` - module or crate in which the trace is defined
/// - `t` - type or additional internal context for making sense of the trace
/// - `a` - action or event described by the trace
///
/// E.g.: `m="tx5" t="signal" a="connected"`
///
/// To see the output, use a tracing configuration such as
/// `RUST_LOG=off,NETAUDIT=trace`.
