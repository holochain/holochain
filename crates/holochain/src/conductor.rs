//! A Conductor manages interactions between its contained [Cell]s, as well as
//! interactions with the outside world. It is primarily a mediator of messages.
//!
//! The Conductor exposes two types of external interfaces:
//! - App interface: used by Holochain app UIs to drive the behavior of Cells,
//! - Admin interface: used to modify the Conductor itself, including adding and removing Cells
//!
//! It also exposes an internal interface to Cells themselves, allowing Cells
//! to call zome functions on other Cells, as well as to send Signals to the
//! outside world
