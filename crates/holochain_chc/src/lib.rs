//! Defines the Chain Head Coordination API and an HTTP client for talking to a remote CHC server.
//!
//! A Chain Head Coordinator (CHC) is an external service which Holochain can communicate with.
//! A CHC is used in situations where it is desirable to run the same Holochain Cell (source chain)
//! on multiple different conductors. The CHC ensures that these multiple devices don't inadvertently
//! create a fork of the source chain by doing simultaneous uncoordinated writes.
//!
//! This crate introduces a [`ChainHeadCoordinator`] trait which defines the interface that Holochain
//! weaves into its logic to make use of a CHC service. Currently, the only Holochain-supported implementation
//! of this trait is [`ChcHttp`][chc_http::ChcHttp], which makes HTTP requests to a remote server and returns the responses.
//! There is also a [`ChcLocal`][chc_local::ChcLocal] reference implementation which is used for testing.
//! Other implementations can be written as needed, including alternate implementations of a HTTP client,
//! or also other kinds of clients using other protocols.
//!
//! Holochain specifies an optional `chc_url` field in its configuration which can point to an HTTP
//! server that implements the CHC interface.
//! See the [`chc_http`] module docs for specs on how to set up a remote CHC HTTP server that
//! Holochain can talk to using the provided [`ChcHttp`] implementation.
//!
//! The CHC trait contains two methods, and Holochain actually only uses one of them:
//! Every time Holochain is about to commit some records to a source chain, it first calls
//! [add_records_request][`ChainHeadCoordinator::add_records_request`]
//! to request that the CHC store those new records.
//! The CHC must be written so that it recognizes that the new records being added are a valid
//! extension of the existing chain of stored records, i.e. that the first record being pushed has a
//! [`Action::prev_action`] field which matches the hash of the last record already stored,
//! and additionally that the new records also form a valid hash chain (via `prev_action`).
//! If the new records are valid, they are added to CHC's chain, and an Ok result is returned.
//!
//! If these criteria for valid new records are not met, the CHC must return [`ChcError::InvalidChain`],
//! which lets the client know that the local chain is out of sync with CHC's version,
//! due to some other conductor having updated its own chain. In this case, the user (the driver
//! of the conductor) should call the other CHC method,
//! [get_record_data_request][`ChainHeadCoordinator::get_record_data_request`],
//! which will return the diff of records that CHC has that the local conductor does not.
//! Then, the Holochain admin method `GraftRecords` can be called to "stitch" these records onto the
//! existing chain, removing any fork if necessary.
//!
//! Note that currently, [get_record_data_request][`ChainHeadCoordinator::get_record_data_request`]
//! is never called directly by Holochain, but it might be in the future.
//!
//! Note also that when a CHC is used, the CHC is always considered the authoritative source of truth.
//! If a local conductor's state for whatever reason contradicts the CHC in any way, whether the local
//! chain contains different data altogether or is strictly ahead of the CHC, the CHC's version is always
//! considered correct and the local chain should always be modified to match the CHC's state.
