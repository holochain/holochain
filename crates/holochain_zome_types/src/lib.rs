//! Holochain Zome Types: only the types needed by Holochain application
//! developers to use in their Zome code, and nothing more.
//!
//! This crate is intentionally kept as minimal as possible, since it is
//! typically included as a dependency in Holochain Zomes, which are
//! distributed as chunks of Wasm. In contrast, the
//! [holochain_types crate](https://crates.io/crates/holochain_types)
//! contains more types which are used by Holochain itself.

/// In wasm it is somewhat impossible to have true secrets because wasm memory is not secure.

///  - The host/rust generally doesn't guarantee to immediately wipe/zero out freed memory, either
///    when a zome call is running or after a wasm instance is thrown away.

/// Most of the time we should just try to minimise the interaction between wasm and secret data.

/// associated with public keys.

/// random bytes and sending them to peers directly.

/// The best we can do here is try to protect ourselves against third parties across the network.
/// e.g. We don't want other machines to simply `remote_call` a successful timing attack.

/// @todo given how impossible it is for wasm to protect its memory from the host, it would make

///
///  - use key exchange protocols like libsodium kx https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/key_exchange.
///  - keep secrets inside lair with all algorithms behind an API, wasm only has access to opaque
