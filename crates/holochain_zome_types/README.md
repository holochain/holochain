zome_types provides the types needed by Holochain application developers in their zome code, nothing more.

This crate is intentionally kept as minimal as possible, since it is typically included as a dependency in Holochain Zomes, which are distributed as chunks of Wasm. In contrast, the [holochain_types crate](https://crates.io/crates/holochain_types) contains more types which are used by Holochain itself.
