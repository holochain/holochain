//! aitia, a crate for gaining insights from causal graphs
//!
//! ("aitia" is the root of "etiology", the study of causes, and also an easy-to-type palindrome)
//!
//! In complex systems, when something is going wrong, it can be difficult to
//! narrow down the dep to some subsystem without doing lots of forensic
//! poking around and exploratory logging. `aitia` aims to help with this process
//! of narrowing down the possible scope of a problem.
//!
//! You define a collection of [`Fact`]s about your system, each of which specifies
//! one or more [`Dep`]s (dependencies). The causal relationships between Depsimply a graph,
//! with each Fact connected to others. When testing your system, you can check whether a
//! particular Fact is true or not. If it's not true, `aitia` recursively follows the causal
//! relationships specified, building up a graph of deps, each of which is checked for
//! truth. The traversal stops only when either:
//! 1. a true fact is encountered, or
//! 2. a fact without any deps of its own is encountered (an "axiom" so to speak)
//! 3. a loop of unresolved deps is discovered, in which case that entire branch is discarded.
//!     Note that loops in causal relationships are allowed, as long as there is a Fact
//!     along the loop which passes, causing the loop to be broken
//!
//! The result is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of all facts that are not true, with the original fact as the root.
//! The edges of the graph represent [logical conditionals or implications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional):
//! i.e. an edge A -> B in the graph means
//! "If A is true, then B must be true", and also "if B is not true, then A cannot be true".
//! This means that the leaves of the DAG represent the possible root deps of the problem, i.e. the
//! "most upstream" known facts which could dep the root fact to not be true, and so the leaves
//! would represent the places in the system to look for the reason why your original fact was not true.
//!
//! `aitia` is as useful as the Facts you write. You can write very broad, vague facts, which can
//! help you hone in on broader parts of the system for further manual investigation, or you can
//! write very specific facts which can tell you at a glance what may be the problem. It lends
//! itself well to writing facts iteratively, broadly at first, and then adding more specificity
//! as you do the work of diagnosing the problems that it helped you find.
//!
//! `aitia` is meant to be an embodiment of the process of deducing the dep of a problem.
//! By encoding your search for a problem into an `aitia::Dep`, ideally you will never have to
//! hunt for that particular problem again.
