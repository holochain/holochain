/// Implements a whole lot of sane defaults for a struct or enum that should behave as an entry.
/// All the entry def fields are available as dedicated methods on the type and matching From impls
/// are provided for each. This allows for both Foo::entry_def() and EntryDef::from(Foo::new())
/// style logic which are both useful in different scenarios.
///
/// For example, the Foo::entry_def() style works best in the entry_defs callback as it doesn't
/// require an instantiated Foo in order to get the definition.
/// On the other hand, EntryDef::from(Foo::new()) works better when e.g. using create_entry() as
/// an instance of Foo already exists and we need the entry def id back for creates and updates.
///
/// If you don't want to use the macro you can simply implement similar fns youself.
///
/// This is not a trait at the moment, it could be in the future but for now these functions and
/// impls are just a loose set of conventions.
///
/// It's actually entirely possible to interact with core directly without any of these.
/// e.g. create_entry() is just building a tuple of EntryDefId and Entry::App under the hood.
///
/// This requires that TryFrom and TryInto SerializedBytes is implemented for the entry type,
/// which implies that serde::Serialize and serde::Deserialize is also implemented.
/// These can all be derived and there is an attribute macro that both does the default defines.
///
///  e.g. the following are equivalent
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[hdk_entry(id = "foo", visibility = "private", required_validations = 6, )]
/// pub struct Foo;
/// ```
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[derive(SerializedBytes, serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
/// pub struct Foo;
/// entry_def!(Foo EntryDef {
///   id: "foo".into(),
///   visibility: EntryVisibility::Private,
///   ..Default::default()
/// });
/// ```
