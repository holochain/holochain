use crate::prelude::*;

/// Wrapper for __call_remote host function.
///
/// There are several positional arguments:
///
/// - agent: The address of the agent to call the RPC style remote function on.
/// - zome: The zome to call the remote function in. Use zome_info() to get the current zome info.
/// - fn_name: The name of the function in the zome to call.
/// - cap_secret: Optional cap claim secret to allow access to the remote call.
/// - payload: The payload to send to the remote function; receiver needs to deserialize cleanly.
///
/// Response is ExternResult which returns ZomeCallResponse of the function call.
/// ZomeCallResponse::ZomeCallNetworkError if there was a network error.
/// ZomeCallResponse::UnauthorizedZomeCall if the provided cap grant is invalid.
/// The Unauthorized case should always be handled gracefully because gap grants can be revoked at
/// any time and the claim holder has no way of knowing until they provide a secret for a call.
///
/// An Ok response already includes an `ExternIO` to be deserialized with `extern_io.decode()?`.
///
/// ```ignore
/// ...
/// let foo: Foo = call_remote(bob, "foo_zome", "do_it", secret, serializable_payload)?;
/// ...
