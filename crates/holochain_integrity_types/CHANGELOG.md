## Unreleased

## 0.0.8

- KeyRef (opaque reference to a secretbox shared secret) is now an unsized byte slice [\#1410](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1410)

### Integrity / Coordinator Changes [\#1325](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1325)

### Added

- `ZomeInfo` now contains the `ScopedZomeTypesSet`. This is all the zome types that are in scope for the calling zome.
- `LinkTypeRanges` for are used querying of links.
- `ScopedZomeTypesSet` and `ScopedZomeTypes` for scoping between local and global zome types.
- `GlobalZomeTypeId` and `LocalZomeTypeId` for identifying zome types within different scopes.
- `UnitEnum` trait for associating an enum with non-unit variants with an equivalent unit variants.
- `EntryDefRegistration` for associating entry defs with entry types.

### Removed

- `EntryDefs::entry_def_index_from_id` is removed because it’s no longer possible to go from an `EntryDefId` to a `GlobalZomeTypeId` as `EntryDefId` is not globally unique.
- `ZomeInfo::matches_entry_def_id` for the same reason as `EntryDefs::entry_def_index_from_id`
- `require_validation_type` is removed because it is no longer used.
- `ZomeId` from `CreateLink` as it’s no longer needed because `LinkType` is a `GlobalZomeTypeId`.
- `ZomeId` from `AppEntryType` as it’s no longer needed because `EntryDefIndex` is a `GlobalZomeTypeId`

### Changed

- ZomeName is now a `Cow<'static, str>` instead of a `String`.
