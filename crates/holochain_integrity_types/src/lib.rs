//! Holochain Integrity Types: only the types needed by Holochain application
//! developers to use in their integrity Zome code, and nothing more.
//!
//! This crate is intentionally kept as minimal as possible, since it is
//! typically included as a dependency in Holochain Zomes, which are
//! distributed as chunks of Wasm.
//!
//! This crate is also designed to be deterministic and more stable than
//! the higher level crates.
