/// These are the operations that can be applied to Holochain data.
/// Every [`Action`] produces a set of operations.
/// These operations are each sent to an authority for validation.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Validate a new entry: <https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/crates/test_utils/wasm/wasm_workspace/validate/src/integrity.rs>
///
/// ## Producing Operations
/// The following is a list of the operations that can be produced by each [`Action`]:
/// - Every [`Action`] produces a [`Op::RegisterAgentActivity`] and a [`Op::StoreRecord`].
/// - [`Action::Create`] also produces a [`Op::StoreEntry`].
/// - [`Action::Update`] also produces a [`Op::StoreEntry`] and a [`Op::RegisterUpdate`].
/// - [`Action::Delete`] also produces a [`Op::RegisterDelete`].
/// - [`Action::CreateLink`] also produces a [`Op::RegisterCreateLink`].
/// - [`Action::DeleteLink`] also produces a [`Op::RegisterDeleteLink`].
///
/// ## Authorities
/// There are three types of authorities in Holochain:
///
/// #### The Action Authority
/// This set of authorities receives the [`Op::StoreRecord`].
/// This is where you can implement your own logic for checking
/// that it is valid to store any of the [`Action`] variants
/// according to your own applications rules.
///
/// #### The Entry Authority
/// This set of authorities receives the [`Op::StoreEntry`].
/// This is where you can implement your own logic for checking
/// that it is valid to store an [`Entry`].
/// You can think of this as the "Create" from the CRUD acronym.
///
/// ##### Metadata
/// The entry authority is also responsible for storing the metadata for each entry.
/// They receive the [`Op::RegisterUpdate`] and [`Op::RegisterDelete`].
/// This is where you can implement your own logic for checking that it is valid to
/// update or delete any of the [`Entry`] types defined in your application.
/// You can think of this as the "Update" and "Delete" from the CRUD acronym.
///
/// They receive the [`Op::RegisterCreateLink`] and [`Op::RegisterDeleteLink`].
/// This is where you can implement your own logic for checking that it is valid to
/// place a link on a base [`Entry`].
///
/// #### The Chain Authority
/// This set of authorities receives the [`Op::RegisterAgentActivity`].
/// This is where you can implement your own logic for checking that it is valid to
/// add a new [`Action`] to an agent source chain.
/// You are not validating the individual record but the entire agents source chain.
///
/// ##### Author
/// When authoring a new [`Action`] to your source chain, the
/// validation will be run from the perspective of every authority.
///
/// ##### A note on metadata for the Action authority.
/// Technically speaking the Action authority also receives and validates the
/// [`Op::RegisterUpdate`] and [`Op::RegisterDelete`] but they run the same callback
/// as the Entry authority because it would be inconsistent to have two separate
/// validation outcomes for these ops.
///
/// ## Running Validation
/// When the `fn validate(op: Op) -> ExternResult<ValidateCallbackResult>` is called
/// it will be passed the operation variant for the authority that is
/// actually running the validation.
///
/// For example the entry authority will be passed the [`Op::StoreEntry`] operation.
/// The operations that can be applied to Holochain data.
/// Operations beginning with `Store` are concerned with creating and
/// storing data.
/// Operations beginning with `Register` are concerned with registering
/// metadata about the data.
