#![warn(missing_docs)]

//! A library and CLI to help create, run, and interact with Holochain conductor setups.
//! **Warning this is still WIP and subject to change**
//! There's probably a few bugs. If you find one please open an [issue](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues)
//! or make a PR.
//!
//! ## CLI
//!
//! The `hc` CLI makes it easy to create, modify, and run hApps that
//! you are working on or someone has sent you.
//! It has been designed to use sensible defaults but still give you
//! the configurability when that's required.
//!
//! Setups are stored in tmp directories by default and the paths are
//! persisted in a `.hc` file which is created wherever you are using
//! the CLI.

// TODO: change this so it inherits clap's formatting.
// Clap 3 and 4 format helptext using colours and bold/underline respectively.
// https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/pull/4765 introduces the ability to style your own help text
// using a library like `color_print`.
// https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/4786 requests that the styler's built-in helper methods
// be exposed to consumers, thereby allowing us to durably make our styling consistent
// with whatever clap's happens to be at the moment.
// I'd prefer the latter approach, if it lands.
