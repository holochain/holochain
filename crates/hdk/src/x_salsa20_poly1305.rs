/// Libsodium secret-key authenticated encryption: secretbox.
///
/// Libsodium symmetric encryption (a shared key to encrypt/decrypt) is called secretbox.
/// Secretbox can be used directly to hide data and is part of cryptographic systems such as
/// [saltpack](https://saltpack.org/).
///
/// Important information about secretbox:
///  - Wasm memory is NOT secure, a compromised host can steal the key.
///  - The key is SECRET, anyone with the key and nonce can read the encrypted message.
///  - The nonce is PUBLIC and UNIQUE, it must NEVER be re-used (so we don't allow it to be set).
///  - It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use [ `TryFromRandom` ] for the key for every message.
///  - Secretbox is designed for 'small' data, break large data into chunks with unique nonces.
///  - Secretbox is NOT quantum resistant.
///
/// @todo shift all the secret handling into lair so that we only work with opaque key references.
///
/// If you want to hide data:
///  - Consider using capability tokens and/or dedicated DHT networks to control access.
///  - Consider how the shared key is being distributed, e.g. maybe use a key exchange protocol.
///  - Consider that a hybrid approach between network access + encryption might be best.
///  - Consider that encrypted data cannot be validated effectively by the public DHT.
///
/// The main use-case is to control access to data that may be broadcast across a semi-trusted or
/// untrusted context, where the intended recipients have all negotiated or shared a key outside
/// that context.
///
/// If you want to encrypt content so that a _specific_ recipient (i.e. public key) can decrypt it
/// then see the libsodium `box` algorithm or similar.

/// Libsodium keypair based authenticated encryption: box.
///
/// Libsodium asymmetric encryption (two keypairs to encrypt/decrypt) is called box.
/// Box can be used directly to hide data and is part of cryptographic systems such as
/// [saltpack](https://saltpack.org/).
///
/// Important information about box:
///  - The secret half of the keypair is generated in and remains in lair.
///  - The nonce is randomly generated in lair for every call to encrypt.
///  - The nonce is PUBLIC and UNIQUE, it must NEVER be re-used (currently can't be set directly).
///  - Box is the same encryption as secretbox using ECDH off the keypairs for the shared key.
///  - Box is repudible. Either keypair can create any message to be read by the other party. Each
///    party knows they did not create a certain message so they know it came from the counterpary
///    but neither can prove to a third party that any message wasn't forged. Note that if you want
///    the opposite it is not enough to simply layer signatures and encryption.
///    See https://theworld.com/~dtd/sign_encrypt/sign_encrypt7.html
///  - To encrypt something potentially large for potentially many recipients efficiently it may be
///    worth chunking the large data, secret boxing it with a unique key for each chunk, then
///    boxing the _keys_ for each recipient alongside the chunks, to avoid encrypting the large
///    data repeatedly for every recipient.
///  - Box is NOT quantum resistant.
///
/// If you want to hide data:
///  - Consider using capability tokens and/or dedicated DHT networks to control access.
///  - Consider how the keypairs are being generated and pubkeys distributed.
///  - Consider that a hybrid approach between network access + encryption might be best.
