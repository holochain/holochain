pub use idk::map_extern::*;

/// Hides away the gross bit where we hook up integer pointers to length-prefixed guest memory
/// to serialization and deserialization, and returning things to the host, and memory allocation
/// and deallocation.
///
/// A lot of that is handled by the holochain_wasmer crates but this handles the boilerplate of
/// writing an extern function as they have awkward input and output signatures:
///
/// - requires remembering `#[no_mangle]`
/// - requires remembering pub extern "C"
/// - requires juggling GuestPtr on the input and output with the memory/serialization
/// - doesn't support Result returns at all, so breaks things as simple as `?`
///
/// This can be used directly as `map_extern!(external_facing_fn_name, internal_fn_name)` but it is
/// more idiomatic to use the `#[hdk_extern]` attribute
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[hdk_extern]
/// pub fn foo(foo_input: FooInput) -> ExternResult<FooOutput> {
///  // ... do stuff to respond to incoming calls from the host to "foo"
/// }
/// ```
