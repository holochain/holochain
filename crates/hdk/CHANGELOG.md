# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/compare/hdk-v0.0.100...HEAD)

## 0.0.106

## 0.0.105

## 0.0.104

## 0.0.103

### Changed

- hdk: `sys_time` returns `Timestamp` instead of `Duration`

### Added

- hdk: Added `accept_countersigning_preflight_request`

- hdk: Added `session_times_from_millis`

- hdk: Now supports creating and updating countersigned entries

- hdk: Now supports deserializing countersigned entries in app entry `try_from`

- hdk: implements multi-call for:
  
  - `remote_call`
  - `call`
  - `get`
  - `get_details`
  - `get_links`
  - `get_link_details`
  
  We strictly only needed `remote_call` for countersigning, but feedback from the community was that having to sequentially loop over these common HDK functions is a pain point, so we enabled all of them to be async over a vector of inputs.
