holo_hash::HoloHash is a hashing framework for Holochain.

Note that not all HoloHashes are simple hashes of the full content as you might expect in a "content-addressable" application. The main exception is `AgentPubKey`, which is simply the key itself to enable self-proving signatures. As an exception it is also named exceptionally, i.e. it doesn't end in "Hash".

## Hash Types

Each HoloHash has a HashType. There are two flavors of HashType: *primitive*, and *composite*

### Primitive HashTypes

Each primitive HashType has a unique 3-byte prefix associated with it, to easily distiguish between hashes in any environment. These prefixes are multihash compatible. The primitive types are:

| hash type | HoloHash alias | prefix |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Agent     | AgentPubKey    | uhCAk  |
| Entry     | EntryHash      | uhCEk  |
| DhtOp     | DhtOpHash      | uhCQk  |
| Dna       | DnaHash        | uhC0k  |
| NetId     | NetIdHash      | uhCIk  |
| Header    | HeaderHash     | uhCkk  |
| Wasm      | DnaWasmHash    | uhCok  |

The "HoloHash alias" column lists the type aliases provided to refer to each type of HoloHash. For instance, `HeaderHash` is the following type alias:

```rust
pub type HeaderHash = HoloHash<hash_type::Header>;
```

(the prefixes listed are the base64 representations)

### Composite HashTypes

Composite hash types are used in contexts when one of several primitive hash types would be valid. They are implemented as Rust enums. The composite types are:

`EntryHash`: used to hash Entries. An Entry can hash to either a `ContentHash` or an `AgentPubKey`.

`AnyDhtHash`: used to hash arbitrary DHT data. DHT data is either a Header or an Entry, therefore AnyDhtHash can refer to either a `HeaderHash` or an `EntryHash`.

## Serialization

HoloHash implements `Display` providing a `to_string()` function accessing the hash as a user friendly string. It also provides TryFrom for string types allowing you to parse this string representation.

HoloHash includes a 4 byte (or u32) dht "location" that serves dual purposes. - It is used as a checksum when parsing string representations. - It is used as a u32 in our dht sharding algorithm.

HoloHash implements [SerializedBytes](https://lib.rs/crates/holochain_serialized_bytes) to make it easy to cross ffi barriers such as WASM and the UI websocket.

## Example

```rust
use holo_hash::*;
use std::convert::TryInto;
use holochain_serialized_bytes::SerializedBytes;

let entry: EntryHash =
    "uhCEkWCsAgoKkkfwyJAglj30xX_GLLV-3BXuFy436a2SqpcEwyBzm"
    .try_into()
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(3860645936, entry.get_loc());

let bytes: SerializedBytes = entry.try_into().unwrap();

assert_eq!(
    "{\"type\":\"EntryHash\",\"hash\":[88,43,0,130,130,164,145,252,50,36,8,37,143,125,49,95,241,139,45,95,183,5,123,133,203,141,250,107,100,170,165,193,48,200,28,230]}",
    &format!("{:?}", bytes),
);
```

## Advanced

Calculating hashes takes time - In a futures context we don't want to block. HoloHash provides sync (blocking) and async (non-blocking) apis for hashing.

```rust
use holo_hash::*;

let entry_content = b"test entry content";

let content_hash = EntryHash::with_data_sync(entry_content.to_vec()).into();

assert_eq!(
    "EntryHash(uhCEkhPbA5vaw3Fk-ZvPSKuyyjg8eoX98fve75qiUEFgAE3BO7D4d)",
    &format!("{:?}", content_hash),
);
```

### Sometimes your data doesn't want to be re-hashed:

```rust
use holo_hash::*;

// pretend our pub key is all 0xdb bytes
let agent_pub_key = vec![0xdb; 32];

let agent_id: HoloHash = AgentPubKey::from_raw_32(agent_pub_key).into();

assert_eq!(
    "AgentPubKey(uhCAk29vb29vb29vb29vb29vb29vb29vb29vb29vb29vb29uTp5Iv)",
    &format!("{:?}", agent_id),
);
```
