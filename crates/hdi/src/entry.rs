/// The validity requirement makes this more complex but notably enables inductive validation of arbitrary graph structures.
/// For example "If this Record is valid, and its parent is valid, up to the root, then the whole tree of Records is valid".
///
/// If at least one authority (1 of N trust) claims the Record is invalid then a conflict resolution/warranting round will be triggered.
///
/// In the case of a total eclipse (every visible authority is lying) then we cannot immediately detect an invalid Record.
/// Unlike `must_get_entry` and `must_get_action` we cannot simply inspect the cryptographic integrity to know this.
///
/// In theory we can run validation of the returned Record ourselves, which itself may be based on `must_get_X` calls.
/// If there is a large nested graph of `must_get_valid_record` calls this could be extremely heavy.
/// Note though that each "hop" in recursive validation is routed to a completely different set of authorities.
/// It does not take many hops to reach the point where an attacker needs to eclipse the entire network to lie about Record validity.
///
/// @TODO We keep signed receipts from authorities serving up "valid records".
/// - If we ever discover a record we were told is valid is invalid we can retroactively look to warrant authorities
/// - We can async (e.g. in a background task) be recursively validating Record dependencies ourselves, following hops until there is no room for lies
/// - We can with small probability recursively validate to several hops inline to discourage potential eclipse attacks with a credible immediate threat
///
