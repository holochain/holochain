#![warn(missing_docs)]

//! The App Manifest format.
//!
//! A running Holochain App (hApp) consists of a collection of Cells (instances
//! of DNA), and these Cells may be shared amongst different apps, enabling
//! inter-app communication. Therefore, in order to install an App, there needs
//! to be a precise specification of what kinds of Cells that App needs available
//! in order to function properly. Such a specification must include info such as:
//! - the acceptable DNA versions that a Cell may use (made possible via DNA
//!   Migrations, which are not yet implemented)
//! - whether a given Cell should be created fresh, or an existing Cell be
//!   borrowed from an already-installed app
//! - whether the app can create cloned copies of a Cell
//!
//! The App Manifest is such a specification. Rather than specify a fixed list
//! of Cells (which would be impossible because each user will be using different
//! Agents and potentially even different versions of a DNA), the manifest
//! is mainly defined by a collection of "roles",
//! each of which may be populated with Cells (instances of DNA) either during
//! app installation or during runtime. Aside from the role definitions, an
//! app also has a `name`, which is used as the `installed_app_id` and must be
//! globally unique, as well as a `description`, which is intended for humans only.
//!
//! Each Role definition specifies what kind of Cell can occupy it.
//! You can think of a Role as a declaration of some piece of functionality
//! that an app needs in order to function, which will be provided by some Cell
//! in a flexible manner depending on the state of the conductor at the time of
//! installation.
//!
//! Each Role definition is made up of:
//! - a RoleName, which only needs to be unique within this App
//! - a provisioning strategy, [`CellProvisioning`], which describes if and how a Cell
//!   should be created freshly for this app, or whether an existing Cell should
//!   occupy this role
//! - a DNA descriptor, [`AppRoleDnaManifest`], which describes where to find the DNA,
//!   the acceptable range of versions, and the cloning limitations.
