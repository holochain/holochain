//! Common types used by other Holochain crates.
//!
//! This crate is a complement to the
//! [holochain_zome_types crate](https://crates.io/crates/holochain_zome_types),
//! which contains only the essential types which are used in Holochain DNA
//! code. This crate expands on those types to include all types which Holochain
//! itself depends on.

#![deny(missing_docs)]
// Toggle this to see what needs to be eventually refactored (as warnings).
#![allow(deprecated)]
// We have a lot of usages of type aliases to `&String`, which clippy objects to.
