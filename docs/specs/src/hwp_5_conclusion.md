# Conclusion

We have described an approach to distributed systems design that achieves increasing capacities of social coordination and coherence without requiring the bottlenecks of global consensus, which delivers on the promise of massively scalable and secure distributed applications fit for heterogeneous contexts. This approach has been fully demonstrated in the form of Holochain's beta 0.1 delivered early in 2023 and specified in [Appendix A](hwp_a_implementation_spec.md).
