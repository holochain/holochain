Conclusion
==========

We have described an approach to distributed systems design that
achieves increasing capacities of social coordination and coherence
without requiring the bottle-necks of global consensus, which delivers
on the promise of massively scalable and secure distributed applications
fit for heterogeneous contexts. This approach has been fully
demonstrated in the form of Holochain's beta 0.1 delivered early in 2023
and specified in Appendix A.
