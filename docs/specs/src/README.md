To build the TEX whitepaper:

1. Make sure you have [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and tex installed.
    * Hint: the easiest route is to install texlive, but most Linux distros have outdated packages, so do the vanilla install. [These are the best instructions](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/95373) I've found.
2. type: `./build.sh`
